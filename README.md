I added a average prcie on the homescreen where it sums up all the total items price and divies it to display the average.
On the Homescreen i added a remove button so if the user doesnt like the item them can hit the remove button
I fixed the filter screen beacuse in my prevoius assigment it didnt work.
The MainMenuScreen displays the added menu screen what is the final screen of the menu
I added buttons on the MainMneuScreen for the user to go back home
I added a button to the Homepage so the user can go to the MainmenuScreen
I made it that The MainMenuScreen is the first screen what pops up when the user opens the app.
